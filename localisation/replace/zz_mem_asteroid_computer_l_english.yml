 mem_asteroid_computer.10.desc:0 "The complex appears to be devoted solely to the computation of a single mathematical equation. The finest [Root.Owner.GetAdj] minds have gone over the problem as it appears in the computer's remaining memory, and have responded unanimously that the system was trying to prove that the universe was a simulation. \n\nPortions of the complex are extensively damaged. This includes the long-term data storage blocks, where any answer to this question would likely have been held. Every indication is that critical systems on the asteroid were purposefully sabotaged. Perhaps someone was not pleased with what the machine had found. Despite this, much of its computational power remains intact. Our work to interface with the alien device may allow us to use it as a research tool."
