 mem_space_race.2.desc:0 "Greetings, [root.GetAdj]. We are organizing a galactic sporting event, a Space Race, through which we hope to identify the most skilled pilots and engineers in the galaxy. We are inviting every major nation - including, of course, yourselves - to participate. Would you like to come?"

 mem_space_race.10.desc.shield:0 "The most recent round of the [From.GetAdj] Space Race took place in the proximity of the star, forcing pilots to rely on their shields to avoid dangerous solar winds and heat. \n\nUnfortunately, our craft was not able to take the heat and was therefore forced to keep its distance from the star, losing precious time on its longer trajectory. It didn't make it to the finish line in time, and has been eliminated."

 mem_space_race.10.desc.thrust:0 "The most recent round of the [From.GetAdj] Space Race involved a long and complex trajectory around many different planets and other massive celestial bodies. \n\nIt seems our craft's engines were not powerful enough to manoeuvre effectively within strong gravity wells, causing it to lose precious time. It didn't make it to the finish line in time, and has been eliminated."

 mem_space_race.10.desc.armor:0 "The most recent round of the [From.GetAdj] Space Race took participants through a thick cloud of space debris, forcing them to rely on their crafts' armour to avoid being disabled by collisions. \n\nOur craft braved the obstacle course for some time, but its hull was unable to take the punishment, and eventually it was damaged to such an extreme that it had to withdraw."

 mem_space_race.13.desc:0 "Today, the fabled [From.GetAdj] Space Race concluded its final round. A grand closing ceremony took place on [From.Capital_Scope.GetName], with [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] [From.Leader.GetHerHim]self congratulating the winners. Our team took the first place and was awarded a precious medal made of pure osmium. The second place and rhodium medal were awarded to the team from the [second_place.GetName]. The third place and iridium medal went to the [third_place.GetName]. \n\nThe race was a unique opportunity for all participants to hone their engineering skills and test themselves against alien cultures."

A grand closing ceremony took place on [From.Capital_Scope.GetName], with [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] [From.Leader.GetHerHim]self congratulating the winners.\n\nOur team took second place and was awarded a precious medal made of pure rhodium. The only team to surpass us was the one from the [first_place.GetName], which was awarded an osmium medal. The third place and iridium medal went to the [third_place.GetName]. \n\nThe race was a unique opportunity for all participants to hone their engineering skills and test themselves against alien cultures."

 mem_space_race.15.desc:0 "Today, the fabled [From.GetAdj] Space Race concluded its final round. A grand closing ceremony took place on [From.Capital_Scope.GetName], with [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] [From.Leader.GetHerHim]self congratulating the winners.\n\nOur team had came third in overall qualification and was awarded a medal of pure iridium. The two teams to surpass us were those from the [first_place.GetName] and the [second_place.GetName], which came first and second and were awarded osmium and rhodium medals respectively. \n\nThe race was a unique opportunity for all participants to hone their engineering skills and test themselves against alien cultures."

Second place and the rhodium medal were awarded to the team from the [second_place.GetName]. Finally, the third place went to the team from the [third_place.GetName], which received an iridium medal. We were eliminated long before winners were decided and earned no medal or fame. \n\nThe race was a unique opportunity for all participants to hone their engineering skills and test themselves against alien cultures."

 mem_space_race.20.desc:0 "Due to the low number of participants that signed up, the [From.GetAdj] Space Race had to be cancelled."

 mem_space_race.22.desc:0 " The [From.GetAdj] Space Race has been cancelled prematurely due to the [From.GetName]'s involvement in a war. Unable to guarantee safety of the contestants, they had to call the event off."
