 akx.9001.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the signal was unexpectedly easy to decipher... but their team has spent considerable time confirming that it's not a hoax. It is a repeating, half-coherent message in the [Root.Owner.GetAdj] language - something like a poem. It repeats the phrases §HGRAVITY IS DESIRE§! and §HTIME IS SIGHT§!. It encodes co-ordinates near the black hole. And it ends with a dedication §Gby name§! to the Science Officer - who adds dispassionately that they have confirmed that the signal has been radiating into interstellar space since before their birth. In fact, the signal may predate our civilization."

 akx.9200.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] has located a small, minimally powered artificial object, broadcasting a looping signal at local range only. These sorts of things usually turn out to be escape pods, and this looks like one of those. It's been out here a long time.\n\nWhen the crew cracks it open - carefully observing quarantine procedures - they find ancient remains, preserved by the sterile pod environment. So far, not unusual. The captain of the [Root.GetName] indicates, however, that they did not expect to find the [Root.Owner.GetAdj] words §HWHAT WAS, WILL BE; WHAT WILL BE, WAS§! daubed on the wall in the bodily fluids of the pod's occupant - who the crew are now wryly referring to as "the Messenger"". They add that there are some equally unexpected anatomical similarities between the Messenger's species, and our own."

 akx.9201.desc:0 "We've established that the escape pod was the kind of commercially available knockoff common in the previous phase of galactic civilization - no new technologies or other insights. The remains of the Messenger, however, are another matter. It's unmistakably an ancestor or a variant of the [Root.Owner.GetAdj] species. Perhaps we have cousins out there - or perhaps we were subject to genetic manipulation by a precursor race. [researchingscientist.GetName] is requesting permission to conduct more extensive research."

 akx.9330.desc:0 "In the years that follow, there are reported sightings of admiral [From.GetName] across [Root.GetAdj] space and beyond. When a celebrated leader dies, this kind of thing is not unknown, of course; and they had become a kind of legend since the Syzygy Rendezvous. But we can't be sure."

 akx.9480.desc:0 "Our ethnographers are fascinated by the complexity of the ceremonies. They hypothesize secret communication channels, steganographic prayer-encodings, or algorithmic underpinnings to the rituals. In fact, they're returning preliminary evidence of this last when their communications abruptly cease. In fact, all communication seems to have ceased, planet-wide. Reports from satellites and survey craft flyovers confirm: there is no activity on the planet at all. No vehicles moving on the road, no emissions or thermal signatures in population centers. No signs of life...\n\nAnd here's the final report. The entire [coils_planet.Owner.GetAdj] population of the planet - including your ethnography team - is absent, with all the business of a sudden but not violent exit. Meals were left unfinished, pets unfed, the occasional house aflame from an unattended stove. Gravitational anomalies were recorded at the assumed time of departure. In almost every street, the looped chalk sigils of the Coils bear witness."

 akx.9490.desc:0 "A report has come in from our observation team on [coils_planet.GetName]: the ceremonies of the Coils of God have ceased. In fact, activity across the planet seems to be at an all-time low. The report indicates that the team are going to follow up with low-altitude passes in a stealth survey craft over major population centers...\n\nThe follow-up report confirms: there is no activity on the planet at all. No vehicles moving on the road, no emissions or thermal signatures in population centers. No signs of life...\n\nAnd here's the final report. The entire [coils_planet.Owner.GetAdj] population of the planet is absent, with all the business of a sudden but not violent exit: meals left unfinished, pets unfed, the occasional house fire. Gravitational anomalies were recorded at the assumed time of departure. In almost every street, the looped chalk sigils of the Coils bear witness."
