 dpe_smallpos_events.2.desc:0 "[root.GetName] has for some time been one of the strongest supporters of the [root.owner.GetAdj] government. Today, its planetary administration unveiled a statue to [root.owner.GetRulerTitle] [root.owner.GetRulerName] to honour [root.owner.leader.GetHisHer] services to the planet and the state, and to prove the planet's dedication to the [root.owner.GetName]."

 dpe_smallpos_events.4.desc:0 "The [dpe_dissident_faction.GetName], led by [dpe_dissident_faction_leader.GetName], has for some time been highly critical of government policy, creating disunity within the state. Today, in a debate broadcast to the entire [root.GetAdj] population, [root.GetRulerTitle] [root.GetRulerName] faced [dpe_dissident_faction_leader.GetName] in a debate and was able to convincingly rebuff all of the latter's criticisms, in the process articulating a positive vision for the future behind which all [root.GetAdj] citizens can unite."

 dpe_smallpos_events.5.desc:0 "The [dpe_dissident_faction.GetName], led by [dpe_dissident_faction_leader.GetName], has for some time been highly critical of government policy, creating disunity within the state. Today, in a debate broadcast to the entire [root.GetAdj] population, [root.GetRulerTitle] [root.GetRulerName] faced [dpe_dissident_faction_leader.GetName] in a debate in an attempt to rebuff the latter's criticisms. However, the attempt backfired, and [dpe_dissident_faction_leader.GetName] was able to come across as the more convincing. This has further weakened the power of the ruling faction."

 dpe_smallpos_events.12.desc:0 "[dpe_talent_leader.GetName], [root.GetDPETalentFlavour] [dpe_talent_planet.GetName][root.GetDPETalentFlavour1], has impressed visiting [root.GetAdj] Army Officers with [dpe_talent_leader.GetHisHer] leadership abilities - so much so that they have suggested that [dpe_talent_leader.GetSheHe] be made a General of the Army. However, [dpe_talent_planet.GetName] are equally keen on keeping [dpe_talent_leader.GetHimHer] and putting [dpe_talent_leader.GetHimHer] in charge of the defence of the planet."

 dpe_smallpos_events.13.desc:0 "[dpe_talent_leader.GetName], [root.GetDPETalentFlavour] [dpe_talent_planet.GetName][root.GetDPETalentFlavour1], has impressed visiting [root.GetAdj] Officials with [dpe_talent_leader.GetHisHer] leadership abilities and good governance record. They have put [dpe_talent_leader.GetHisHer] name forward to be given higher responsibilities within the [root.GetName]'s governance structure. However, [dpe_talent_leader.GetSheHe] is beloved by [dpe_talent_planet.GetName]'s population, who would be sad to see [dpe_talent_leader.GetHimHer] go."

 dpe_smallpos_events.14.desc:0 "[dpe_talent_leader.GetName], the naval officer in charge of [dpe_talent_starport_system.GetName] Starbase, has impressed visiting [root.GetAdj] Navy Officers with [dpe_talent_leader.GetHisHer] leadership abilities - so much so that they have suggested that [dpe_talent_leader.GetSheHe] be made an Admiral of the Fleet."

 cc_luddite.30.desc:0 "Following the introduction of robotic workers into the [root.GetName], a wave of enthusiasm about AI and robotics has spread through the [root.GetAdj] population. Naysayers that worry about the impact and potential risks of the large-scale usage of robots are being marginalised, their doubts swept away by the significant improvement in standard of living robots have brought. The robots are now extremely sought after by the general populace, and dozens of robotics-related start-ups are launched every day."

 dpe_defect_leader.2.B.tooltip:0 "Hand [dpe_defect_leader.GetHimHer] over to the [dpe_defected_country.GetAdj] authorities. They will be pleased."

 dpe_defect_leader.7.desc:0 "It appears that our confidence in [dpe_defect_leader.GetName] was not misplaced. Not only has [dpe_defect_leader.GetSheHe] not defected, but [dpe_defect_leader.GetSheHe] has managed to restore public confidence in [dpe_defect_leader.GetHimHer]self, and is now seen as a model of xeno integration into [root.GetAdj] society."

 dpe_defect_leader.10.desc:0 "My [root.GetRulerTitle], it has come to my notice that you are investigating me for my supposed disloyalty to the [root.GetName]. As one who has always considered [dpe_defect_leader.GetHimHer]sel[dpe_defect_leader.GetFVes] a [root.GetAdj] citizen as much as a [dpe_defect_leader.GetSpeciesName], I am most disappointed in this lack of confidence in me. It is therefore with regret that I must tender my resignation. I cannot serve a government in which I am not welcome."

 dpe_defect_leader.11.desc:0 "It has come to our attention that [dpe_defect_leader.GetName], a [dpe_defect_leader.GetSpeciesName] who had been a high government official in the [from.GetName], faces persecution on account of [dpe_defect_leader.GetHisHer] species. Taking up [dpe_defect_leader.GetHisHer] case could be a good opportunity to embarrass the [from.GetName] while furthering the [root.GetAdj] cause."

 dpe_defect_leader.12.desc:0 "[root.GetAdj], we have heard that you are persecuting one of our nationals, [dpe_defect_leader.GetName], on account of [dpe_defect_leader.GetHisHer] species. We demand that [dpe_defect_leader.GetSheHe] be allowed to take asylum in the [from.GetName]."
