 envoy_events.1.name:0 "Insulting [envoy_source.GetAdj] Envoy"

 envoy_events.1.desc:0 "It appears that a mischievous third party was able to hack into the translation software of the [envoy_source.GetAdj] envoy to [Root.Capital.GetName], [event_envoy.GetName], so that instead of uttering magnanimous platitudes, [event_envoy.GetSheHe] began spewing vicious insults that left none unscathed. The malfunction in [event_envoy.GetHerHis] equipment was duly uncovered, but not before [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] was declared to be a "vile [ruler_species.GetNameInsult]" - a grave insult which surely calls for a response."

 envoy_events.2.desc.pos:0 "$envoy_events.2.desc.base$\n\nFortunately, the malfunction was swiftly uncovered and the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] took the incident with a sense of humor. Indeed, recordings of the "inappropriate [Root.GetAdj] envoy" are circulating widely, causing much mirth among their people."

 envoy_events.2.B:0 "A noble contribution to [From.GetAdj] society."

 envoy_events.3.desc.base:0 "[event_envoy.GetName], our [Root.GetEnvoy] representing our interests in the Galactic Community, has committed a major faux pas, mistaking the [council_country.GetAdj] delegate for a [pathetic_country.GetAdj]. Unfortunately, the incriminating remarks were witnessed by many onlookers, who duly showered [event_envoy.GetName] with ridicule."

 envoy_events.5.desc:0 "The [envoy_source.GetAdj] envoy, [event_envoy.GetName], has been exasperatingly tiresome in [event_envoy.GetHerHis] efforts to represent [envoy_source.GetAdj] interests in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Right from [event_envoy.GetHerHis] first arrival, [event_envoy.GetSheHe] [event_envoy.GetHasHave] shown unremitting hostility towards the [Root.GetGovernmentName], unleashing an almost constant barrage of objections to our policies and actions. So great an irritation [event_envoy.GetHasHave] [event_envoy.GetSheHe] been that few would weep to see the back of [event_envoy.GetHerHim], and we have heard whispers that a group of [Root.GetAdj] loyalists are plotting to expedite [event_envoy.GetHerHis] demise.\n\nAllowing this scheme to succeed would certainly be convenient, but allowing foreign dignitaries to be assassinated in our realm might not be the best of looks."

 envoy_events.6.desc:0 "[event_envoy.GetName] - the envoy we sent to mediate our disagreements with the [From.GetName] - has been murdered! [event_envoy.GetSheHeCap] disappeared without a trace several days ago, missing [event_envoy.GetHerHis] scheduled sync with the [Root.GetRulerTitle]'s council. After several days of searching, [event_envoy.GetHerHis] remains were found in a storage container destined to be incinerated.\n\nThe [From.GetAdj] authorities have been strangely evasive when asked to investigate, arousing suspicions that they were behind the killing - especially since [event_envoy.GetName] had been highly critical of the [From.GetGovernmentName] in recent times."

 envoy_events.7.desc:1 "It seems that, instead of performing [event_envoy.GetHerHis] task and representing [Root.GetAdj] interests, our envoy [event_envoy.GetName] has fallen for the charms of a [other_species_nation.GetAdj] diplomat. Fearing the repercussions of this transgression, the pair have eloped to the [third_party.GetName]: a nation whose dangerously liberal constitution permits such unions.\n\nIn doing this, [event_envoy.GetName] has forfeited [event_envoy.GetHerHis] position as our envoy. However, this loss of control over our own officials has hurt our galactic standing. We must restore our reputation by apprehending the miscreant!"

 envoy_events.8.desc:0 "Esteemed [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]! It has come to our attention that a [From.GetAdj] criminal has taken refuge in your nation. The miscreant, our former envoy [event_envoy.GetName], broke all bonds of loyalty - along with the most fundamental laws of our nation - to elope with a [other_species_nation.GetAdj].\n\nWe would kindly ask that the criminal be returned to us, so that [event_envoy.GetSheHe] can face trial for [event_envoy.GetHerHis] crimes."

 envoy_events.13.desc:0 "It seems the [From.GetName] were so displeased by our refusal to extradite their rogue envoy [event_envoy.GetName] to them that they took matters into their own hands and launched a retrieval mission. However, this mission was bungled, as we intercepted the [From.GetAdj] vessel carrying their special operatives as it attempted to cross the border. Measures have been taken to ensure that future attempts will be similarly unsuccessful."

 envoy_events.14.desc:0 "The team we sent to retrieve our rogue envoy, [event_envoy.GetName], was unsuccessful in its mission; their vessel was taken into [From.GetAdj] custody as they tried to cross the border. The [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are predictably incensed and are decrying [Root.GetAdj] interference in their affairs. For their part, our citizens are dismayed at our handling of the affair and our failure to retrieve the criminal."
