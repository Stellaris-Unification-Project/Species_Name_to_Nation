 crisis.4140.desc:2 "For a long time we [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have known that we are meant for greater things. That our destiny was nothing less than the fate of the universe itself.\n\nOver the last couple of years this notion has grown stronger to the point that it can no longer be denied that great change is coming for [Root.GetAdj] society. In fact we stand on the precipice right now.\n\nThe galaxy may not be ready for our inevitable dominion, but the [Root.GetName] is ready for the galaxy. We will be misunderstood. We will be opposed. But we will not be stopped."

 crisis.4150.desc:1 "The years go by, and yet the fires within each [Root.GetAdj] burns with unshakable determination. Our dominion is expanding and so is the magnitude of our efforts.\n\nAs we encounter other empires we only have to give them two options: unconditional allegiance or complete annihilation. That is, if they are given an option at all.\n\nOne way or the other, the [Root.GetName] keeps growing."

 crisis.4155.desc:2 "A great change is coming. The [Root.GetName] is on the verge of realizing our supreme goal. Each and every [Root.GetAdj] feel it with every fiber of their being - our destiny is at hand.\n\nOur experience - nay, our very history - of forceful expansion still rewards us with new ways to subjugate our enemies and usurp control of a galaxy in turmoil.\n\nSurely those who dare stand against us must see the futility of their whimpering efforts."

 espionage.10.desc:2 "Our presence in the §Y[from.target.GetName]§! has taken on a clandestine aspect. $role_spymaster$ [from.leader.GetName] is now situated at the core of a burgeoning §HSpy Network§! in [from.target.GetAdj] space."

 espionage.11.desc:2 "Our presence in the §Y[from.target.GetName]§! has taken on a clandestine aspect: $role_spymaster$ [from.leader.GetName] has engaged Espionage protocols. Our newly-established §HSpy Network§! will allow us to observe [from.target.GetAdj] activities, infiltrating and intervening where necessary."

 espionage.17.desc:2 "We have received our first clandestine report from $role_spymaster$ [from.leader.GetName], inside the §Y[from.target.GetName]§!. This heralds the foundation of our first §HSpy Network§! within a xeno empire.

 espionage.1011.desc:1 "There have been no further messages from our disavowed operative within the §Y[disavowed_agent_country.GetName]§!. The matter is being considered as resolved.\n\nWe may never know if there really was a former operative - nor will we know if there actually was useful intelligence to be had. If this was instead a [disavowed_agent_country.GetAdj] ruse: we can safely state that their ploy has failed."

 espionage.1012.desc:1 "We have received a rather brusk statement from the §Y[disavowed_agent_country.GetName]§!. They claim to have been approached by a §Hformer [root.GetAdj] spy§!, and that we are to be held to account. Furthermore, this individual is set to suffer every punishment their society has set for 'foreign agents'.\n\n$espionage.1012.desc.end$"

[disavowed_agent_governor.GetHeSheCap] claim[disavowed_agent_governor.GetSXX] to have been approached by someone who had, in turn, identified themself as a §Hformer [root.GetAdj] spy§!. The [disavowed_agent_country.GetAdj] representative used few words, but keenly expressed their empire's narrow tolerance for 'foreign agents'.\n\n$espionage.1012.desc.end$"

 espionage.1013.desc:1 "We have received an unusual statement from the §Y[disavowed_agent_country.GetName]§!, claiming they have been approached by a §Hformer [root.GetAdj] spy§!. If the message is to be believed, the disavowed operative not only exists, but felt no recourse other than to defect - only to be dismissed outright by [disavowed_agent_country.GetAdj] authorities. Or so the message claims.\n\nThe [disavowed_agent_country.GetName] do not state precisely what their next course of action will be, but such an individual would almost certainly be placed under close observation for as long as they remain there. As a formality, the [disavowed_agent_country.GetName] have issued a diplomatic sanction against us for this 'violation of sovereign territory'."

 espionage.1016.desc.end:0 "A specially-chosen task force was able to confirm the existence of this individual - before swiftly ending it. However, no one can be certain if this was a genuine operative, or part of a [disavowed_agent_country.GetAdj] ploy.\n\nEither way: both the operative's existence and the information they claimed to hold have now been put safely beyond the reach of either empire."

 espionage.1017.desc:1 "The clandestine strike team we sent into the §Y[disavowed_agent_country.GetName]§! have returned with great haste. It seems there never was a disavowed operative. Instead what the team found was subtle evidence of a plot to expose our clandestine operations.\n\nPerhaps this was a scheme intended to further [disavowed_agent_country.GetAdj] goals; perhaps an external body sought to meddle in our affairs. In either case: our containment measures were aborted just in time to avoid exposing our intelligence operations, past or present."

 espionage.1021.desc:4 "Our once-disavowed operative has made it back to [root.GetAdj] space. This §H[disavowed_agent_country.GetAdj] individual§! - who identified [disavowed_operative.GetHimselfHerself] as [disavowed_operative.GetName] - appears nervous and relieved, but has cleared all security verification. The debriefing has been described as arduous, but the information has proven to be useful - we have now gained access to a valuable §YAsset§!.\n\nWith the matter now resolved, [disavowed_operative.GetName]'s shaky disavowal will be renewed. Having confirmed that [disavowed_operative.GetHeShe] [disavowed_operative.GetIsAre] no longer missing in action, our current operatives can ensure that this time, the disavowal will stick."

It seems they were engaged in an operation against us, the details of which are unknown to us yet.\n\nThrough our interrogations, however, we have gathered some small amount of Intel on the §H[luckycatch_country.GetName]§!. Our $role_spymaster$ now also has access to a local §YAsset§! with which we can press this advantage."

 espionage.1050.desc:1 "A particularly observant operative in the §Y[finderskeepers_country.GetName]§! has laid their [root.species.GetHandNamePlural] on part of a §H[finderskeepers_country.GetAdj] encryption key§!. It would seem a careless [finderskeepers_country.GetAdj] $job_administrator$ mislaid the device whilst commuting.\n\nThis bodes well enough for our operations in the [finderskeepers_country.GetName], but our study of the device's unique design has revealed novel insights for our general approach to §Y$MOD_INTEL_DECRYPTION_ADD$§!."

 espionage.1070.desc.identified.intro:1 "Our Encryption measures have caught a band of dangerous infiltrators. These would-be hostiles appear to be working on behalf of the §H[hostile_infiltration_country.GetName]§!, on a scheme which would have cost many [root.species.GetAdj] lives and caused us significant damage."

 espionage.1070.desc.identified.hostile:1 "$espionage.1070.desc.identified.intro$\n\nAmongst the materials we forcibly extracted from them were a number of communication logs, which we have managed to decrypt. None describes the full scope of their plans against us; [hostile_infiltration_country.GetAdj] security seems at least capable enough to yield only patchy Intel to us. Everything else we may extract from them is deemed unreliable information.\n\nDespite the justified outrage we may wish to express, we would be wise to consider our response. We could keep quiet about our own Encryption skill, feigning ineptitude in front of our enemies. Were we to expose the [hostile_infiltration_country.GetName] for this planned act of violence against us, however, we might find those enemies even regarding us with sympathy."

 espionage.1081.desc.outro:0 "Quite how this information came to be known by the [insidious_plot_spynetwork.GetAdj] is unclear. Our own operatives' efforts to tail suspected [insidious_plot_spynetwork.GetAdj] intelligence operatives seem to have paid off, though. If this intelligence is genuine, the [insidious_plot_spynetwork.GetAdj] may just have done the hard work of gathering it for us."

 espionage.1081.desc.samecountry:0 "Our operatives in the §Y[insidious_plot_spynetwork.GetName]§! have uncovered credible rumors of a local plot against us. It seems their §H[insidious_plot_country.GetAdj]§! counterparts are somewhat careless about their own operational secrecy.\n\nWe have no exact details for their apparent scheme yet, but it's said to involve a manipulation of our existing relationships - undermining agreements of trust and our very way of life."

 espionage.1085.desc.neverspied:0 "Amazingly, we have been implicated in some vaguely-defined plot against the §H[from.GetName]§!. It's a ridiculous allegation, given our complete lack of foreign espionage activity so far - but then, the [from.GetAdj] would have no way of knowing how truly ridiculous the allegation is.\n\nIt would seem that parties unknown are attempting to frame us for their own misdemeanors - or perhaps simply to sow some diplomatic chaos.
