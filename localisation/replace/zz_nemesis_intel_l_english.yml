 action.1.desc_hacking_03:0 "Do not believe your attempt to steal our data went unnoticed, [Root.GetAdj] - the [contact_empire.GetGovernmentName] sees all! We have dedicated a portion of our consciousness to watching for your future misdeeds."

 action.1.desc_hostile_01:0 "Your show of hostility is very concerning, [Root.GetAdj]. Our [contact_empire.GetRulerTitle] wishes to let it be known that we will not bow to your threats or intimidation."

 action.1.desc_hostile_02:0 "Why such hostility, [Root.GetAdj]? We mean you no harm!"

 action.1.desc_hostile_05:0 "Your show of hostility is very concerning, [Root.GetAdj]. We can only assume that you are crazed [Root.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult] in need of being put down by the superior [Root.GetAdj]."

 action.1.desc_they_hostile_03:0 "Your kind represents a grave threat to the Hive, [Root.GetAdj]. Our drones have already begun our planned actions to mitigate the risk you pose. Should this prove insufficient, further action will be necessary."

 action.1.desc_vivisection_01:0 "We will not rest until we have avenged the [contact_empire.GetSpeciesNamePlural] who found their deaths on your operating table, [Root.GetAdj]!"

 action.1.desc_they_hungry_02:0 "The raw materials we melted your drones down to were most valuable. We anticipate that our forges will soon be filled with [Root.GetAdj] scrap metal."

 first_contact.103.desc:0 "$first_contact.103.desc.base$\n\nRemarkably, they appear to completely lack the concept of individuality that is inherent in the [This.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] species. Indeed, the individual [This.ContactCountry.GetAdj] "drone" has no free will or thought whatsoever and is a mere pawn of the §H"hive mind"§!. Far from chafing under such tight control, our [This.Owner.GetResearchers] speculate that the [This.ContactCountry.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have evolved to depend on this collective intelligence and would not be able to survive without it."

 first_contact.1105.desc:0 "We have concluded our study of the §H[contact_country.GetAdj]§! aliens we recently captured. The hostages proved unwilling to cooperate with us, but this became a moot point as we began to cut them open. We now know a great deal about the internal functions of their [contact_country.GetSpeciesOrganNamePlural], [contact_country.GetSpeciesEarNamePlural], [contact_country.GetSpeciesHandNamePlural] and other body parts, giving our genetics [Root.GetResearchers] valuable §Hxenobiological data§!.\n\nDriven to terror by the cruelty of our actions, a handful of the [contact_country.GetSpeciesNamePlural] cooperated with us as we sought to translate their language and access their computer systems. As a result, we now have considerable intelligence we are able to deploy against them, should the need arise."

 first_contact.1105.desc.hive_victim:0 "We have concluded our study of the §H[contact_country.GetAdj]§! aliens we recently captured. As became apparent when they opened communications with us, they are indeed organized as a §Hhive mind§!, with individual drones lacking autonomy or agency. Although they proved unuseful subjects for interrogation, this became a moot point as we began to cut them open. We now know much about the internal functions of their [contact_country.GetSpeciesOrganNamePlural], [contact_country.GetSpeciesEarNamePlural], [contact_country.GetSpeciesHandNamePlural] and other body parts, giving our genetics [Root.GetResearchers] valuable §Hxenobiological data§!.\n\nThough it took a bit longer than we might have hoped, the biological knowledge we gained helped us to crack their language - and their computer codes. We now possess considerable intelligence to deploy against them, should it prove necessary!"

 first_contact.1105.desc.machine_victim:0 "We have concluded our study of the §H[contact_country.GetAdj]§! machines we recently captured. Once cut off from their parent AI, the drones lacked agency and gave off little useful information of their own accord. Once we began dissembling them, we were able to make more progress - both in understanding their internal functioning, and in finding out more about them. It turned out their processors were no match for the invasive data gathering techniques we used on them, with the result that little about them is now secret to us.\n\nWe now possess considerable intelligence to deploy against their parent AI, the §H[contact_country.GetName]§!, should we see fit."

 first_contact.1110.desc:0 "We have concluded our study of the §H[contact_country.GetAdj]§! aliens we recently captured. The hostages were initially unwilling to cooperate with us, but once communications were established with the [contact_country.GetName], we were able to make much faster progress. Before long, we were able to "persuade" them to grant us access to their computer systems.\n\nThanks to the information we have gleaned from them, we have amassed considerable intelligence on their activities and capabilities."

 first_contact.1110.desc.weak:0 "We have concluded our study of the §H[contact_country.GetAdj]§! aliens we recently captured. The hostages were remarkably weak-willed and showed no particular desire to keep us from finding out about them; indeed, they proved extremely cooperative. Before long, we were able to persuade them to grant us access to their computer systems.\n\nThanks to the information we have gleaned from them, we have amassed considerable intelligence on their activities and capabilities."

 first_contact.1110.desc.strong:0 "We have concluded our study of the §H[contact_country.GetAdj]§! aliens we recently captured. The hostages proved remarkably unwilling to cooperate with us, resisting even the most persuasive methods of our interrogators. However, once communications were established with the [contact_country.GetName], we were able to make some progress - including gaining access to some of their basic computer systems - although we suspect that they were able to keep many details back. Before long, we were able to "persuade" them to grant us access to their computer systems.\n\nThanks to the information we have gleaned from them, we have amassed considerable intelligence on their activities and capabilities."

 first_contact.1110.desc.machine_victim:0 "We have concluded our study of the §H[contact_country.GetAdj]§! machines we recently captured. Once cut off from their parent AI, the drones lacked agency, and we were able to find out little of use from them as their functionality rapidly degraded.\n\n$first_contact.285.desc.gestalt_end$"

 first_contact.1110.desc.hive_victim:0 "We have concluded our study of the §H[contact_country.GetAdj]§! aliens we recently captured. As became apparent when they opened communications with us, they are indeed organized as a §Hhive mind§!, with individual drones lacking autonomy or agency. Cut off from the body, the drones seemed aimless and died off one by one, not yielding much in the way of useful information except as unwitting biological specimens.\n\n$first_contact.285.desc.gestalt_end$"

 first_contact.322.desc.planet:0 "While some were worried at the incursion of unknown alien vessels into our space, it was not clear until now just how much of a threat the [From.Owner.GetName] posed. It seems they landed a covert team on a remote part of [abduction_planet.GetName] and seized living [This.Owner.GetAdj] hostages, escaping into the depths of space before we could mount a rescue party. We can only imagine what tortures they will suffer at the hands of their captors."

 first_contact.425.desc:0 "Although it proved a considerable challenge, we have managed to decode the form of communication used by the §H[This.ContactCountry.GetName]§! sufficiently to establish preliminary contact. It seems that they call themselves the §H[This.ContactCountry.GetRealName]§!. Inevitably, communication can only happen with the help of communication systems specifically tuned to the [This.ContactCountry.Species.GetAdj] language - something which rather hinders fluent conversation..."

 first_contact.5030.desc:0 "As we began to pick up more and more visual images of the aliens known as the §H[This.ContactCountry.GetName]§!, it was inevitable that these would eventually be leaked to the wider public. Their appearance has proven delightful to the [This.Owner.GetAdj] public, who are now impatient to make closer acquaintance with these aliens."

 first_contact.5030.desc.machine:0 "As we began to pick up more and more visual images of the aliens known as the §H[This.ContactCountry.GetName]§!, it quickly became clear that we are dealing with a society of robots. It was only a matter of time before this knowledge was leaked to the wider public. The revelation has provoked wonder among the [This.Owner.GetAdj] public, who marvel that machines could build their own spacefaring civilization, and are impatient to make closer acquaintance with them."
