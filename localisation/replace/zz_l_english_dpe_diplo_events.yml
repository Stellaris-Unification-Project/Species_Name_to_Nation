A scientist on the mission has managed to work out how it works, and has drawn up a plan as to how it could be used within the [root.GetName]. However, the [from.GetAdj] authorities have refused to allow her to send us her work, claiming that this was not part of the agreement."

 dpe_xenophile_mission.175.desc:0 "Dear [root.GetAdj], we have apprehended some troublemakers from your delegation. It seems that they were attempting to smuggle our technologies to you. Please ensure that this does not happen again - it would be most inconvenient if the public were to come to believe your delegation was spying on us, forcing to take further action..."

 dpe_xenophile_mission.176.desc:0 "Dear [root.GetAdj], we must inform you that your cultural mission to our worlds is over. Likewise, we are withdrawing our mission from your worlds. We reached this decision after apprehending a number of [root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] as they were attempting to smuggle our technologies out of the [from.GetName] - apparently on your command. This has shaken our trust in you. We will think twice before cooperating with the [root.GetAdj] again."

dpe_xenophile_mission.150.desc:0 "With the [from.GetAdj] delegation due to return home soon, a number of [from.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have chosen to marry their [root.GetAdj] partners and remain in the [root.GetName] instead."

dpe_xenophile_mission.152.desc:0 "With the [from.GetAdj] delegation due to return home soon, the situation of the [from.GetSpeciesName]-[root.GetSpeciesName] couples that have formed has taken on a new importance. [root.GetAdj] law does not currently present a clear ruling on the legality of such partnerships, creating considerable uncertainty for the individuals involved. The [xenophile_faction.GetName] has agreed to represent their cause, and is pushing for such unions to be recognised within the [root.GetName] - though more conservative elements in society abhor the very idea of them. Should we allow interspecies marriage?"

dpe_xenophile_mission.154.desc:0 "As our delegates to the [from.GetName] return home, we have become aware that many [root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have elected to remain with their [from.GetAdj] partners in the [from.GetName], despite such practices being against our laws. Although there is little we can do to stop them from doing this, public opinion is split as to whether these individuals deserve our condemnation or our sympathy."

dpe_xenophile_mission.101.desc:0 "It is with a touch of sadness that our delegation to the [from.GetName] and the [from.GetAdj] delegation to our state return home today. The initiative has been a great success! Over the past ten years, both our peoples have come to understand each other well, and many new friendships have been born. We are hopeful that we are entering an era of lasting peace and cooperation between the [root.GetName] and the [from.GetName]."

dpe_xenophile_mission.104.desc:0 "Our delegation to the [from.GetName] and the [from.GetAdj] delegation to our state return home today. From the point of view of establishing better relations between our species, the mission was a dismal failure: The two species simply weren't able to connect with each other very well. There were multiple unpleasant incidents, and if anything, each species' opinion towards the other hardened over time. However, [root.GetDPEDeceitSuccess]"

 dpe_contraband_event.1.desc:0 "Our law enforcement services have discovered that a collection of our citizens have been smuggling goods into the [dpe_neighbor.GetName]. The goods they are smuggling are perfectly legal within our own realm, but their effect on [dpe_neighbor.GetAdj] biology is that of a moderately effective hallucinatory drug - the [dpe_neighbor.GetAdj] government has therefore placed very harsh restrictions on them.\n\nSome of the smugglers are average citizens running rings with individuals they know on the other side, others are large corporations that sell legitimate goods along with contraband. Combined, these groups earn quite a bit of money and contribute to the economy. How should we deal with them?"

 dpe_contraband_event.90.desc:0 "The [from.GetAdj] ambassador has approached our minister of foreign affairs with an interesting story: Apparently, their government recently uncovered several smuggler rings operating on the edge of their space, which had been sneaking considerable quantities of hallucinatory drugs into our territory. Once discovered, the [from.GetAdj] authorities cracked down on these bands of rogues, preventing a potential contraband crisis in our empire."

 dpe_contraband_event.2.desc:0 "Local authorities across our planets are reporting a massive spike in the usage of a certain hallucinatory drug, the trade and usage of which is illegal under [root.GetAdj] law. The scale of the problem is so serious that it has become obvious that this needs to be dealt with on a national level. How should we respond?"

 dpe_contraband_event.21.desc.extort:0 "The [from.GetName] has legalised the contraband goods that our citizens were smuggling into their territory, a trade through which we had been extorting significant revenues. Now that the threat of getting on the wrong side of the law no longer exists, our traders are refusing to pay us the money agreed, and have let it be known that they will inform the [from.GetAdj] authorities of our transgressions if we insist."

 dpe_contraband_event.51.desc:0 "Our agents have been interrogating suspects thought to be involved in the contraband smuggling, and have uncovered a very important piece of evidence. The agents managed to get a lead on a group of smugglers operating near one of our border worlds. After setting up an ambush, they managed to disable one of the smuggler vessels. As they boarded the ship, they were met with a brief firefight, but quickly overtook the bandits. To their shock, half of those involved were [dpe_drugs_country.GetAdj] citizens! These rogues were brought to a detention center for questioning, where they admitted that the [dpe_drugs_country.GetName] was allowing these smuggler rings to operate as long as they gave a percentage to the government. How shall we respond?"

 dpe_contraband_event.51.B.tooltip:0 "Avoid discussing the politics of the event, and quietly contact the [dpe_drugs_country.GetAdj] ambassador to offer their citizens' deportation in return for action."

 dpe_contraband_event.52.desc:0 "The investigation into the source of the contraband products has been making slow progress, but a breakthrough has finally been made: Our customs officials have discovered a large quantity of hallucinatory drugs hidden in falsely marked crates amidst a massive shipment of goods coming from the [dpe_drugs_country.GetName], which a major [dpe_drugs_country.GetAdj] corporation had been importing into our country. Further investigation has shown that the drug has a considerably lower impact on [dpe_drugs_country.GetSpeciesNamePlural], and is consequently commonplace in their country. Our intelligence and border security departments therefore suspect that this is not an isolated incident and have begun a thorough audit of everything crossing the border from them. How should we respond? "

 dpe_contraband_event.53.desc:0 "Our law enforcement agencies have found a lead on the source of the drugs that have flooded into our country. They began sectioning off areas where reports of drug use had been concentrated, and systematically interrogated anyone deemed suspect. By doing this, they caught a rather cowardly dealer who was willing to spill the beans in exchange for a lighter punishment. Fortuitous carelessness on the part of the drug cartel meant that his information allowed us to trace the identities of the smugglers. To our surprise, most of them are [dpe_drugs_country.GetAdj] citizens - in fact, they have been smuggling the drugs from the [dpe_drugs_country.GetName], where they are legal.\n\nOur subsequent investigations have uncovered no evidence that the [dpe_drugs_country.GetAdj] government is complicit in the smuggling rings, but our intelligence agency believes they probably knew of their citizens' activities but failed to act. What is our next step? "

 dpe_contraband_event.69.desc:0 "Esteemed friend, we have caught a certain number of your citizens smuggling drugs into our country. This is creating a significant drugs crisis in the [from.GetName]. For this reason, we have elected to introduce more stringent border controls, severely limiting [root.GetAdj] access to our space. We thank you for your understanding."

 dpe_contraband_event.901.desc:0 "The [from.GetName] has closed its border with us. This move has made it far harder for our smugglers to deliver drugs into their country. Unfortunately, the [from.GetAdj] authorities have noticed the correlation and (correctly) decided that we must have been the guilty party. This has somewhat cooled our relations."

Many of the more zealous democrats believe that we should use this unique opportunity and, instead of helping fix the elections, push for free and fair elections in the [from.GetName]. However, our more cautious advisors point out that this could potentially ruin our relationship with the [from.GetAdj] government, as well as our standing in the eyes of other nations.\n\nAre we going to play along and fake the election, or should we publish the true results?"
