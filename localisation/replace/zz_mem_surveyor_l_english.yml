 mem_surveyor.243.desc.3.1:0 "The Berserker Probe is heading towards you, [Root.GetAdj]. When it strikes, I hope you have the courage to fight it with honour. Do not falter, even if odds are not in your favour."

 mem_surveyor.243.2.a.response:0 "And what does become me, [Root.GetAdj]?\n\nGetting slaughtered by the Berserker Probe as my government watches helplessly, like a good dwamak would.\n\nI chosen my path.\n\nHYEEIIIIEEEEE!!!!!"

 mem_surveyor.300.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] reports that [Leader.GetHisHer] survey has been inconclusive so far. The amount of artifacts on [From.GetName] is immense, and so is the damage they sustained. Both defy the surveying capacities of the [Root.GetName] or any other [Owner.GetAdj] mobile laboratory.\n\nThe best course of action would be to construct a research station above the broken world and hope that sifting through the remnants will paint a clearer picture."
