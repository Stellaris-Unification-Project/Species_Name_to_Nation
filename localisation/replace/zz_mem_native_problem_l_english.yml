 mem_native_problem.4.desc:0 "The mysterious shooter responsible for multiple deaths on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has finally been cornered deep inside limestone cavern networks by the authorities and killed after putting up fierce resistance. \n\nSurpisingly, the perpetrator turned out to be [Owner.GetAdj], but not a colonist who moved to the planet officially as part of the colonisation project. The tattered flight suit [the_guy.GetSheHe] was wearing indicates that this was [the_guy.GetName] - captain of a small private vessel that vanished without a trace about ten years ago. \n\nIt is likely [the_guy.GetSheHe] crashed the ship and somehow survived on the planet's surface ever since. It's not entirely clear what caused [the_guy.GetHerHim] to attack the colonists, but prolonged wilderness exposure likely had a negative impact on [the_guy.GetHerHis] sanity."

 mem_native_problem.5.desc:0 "The mysterious shooter responsible for multiple deaths on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has finally been cornered deep inside limestone cavern networks by the authorities. After a brief skirmish, [the_guy.GetSheHe] was subdued and detained. \n\nSurprisingly, the perpetrator turned out to be [Owner.GetAdj], but not a colonist who moved to the planet officially as part of the colonisation project. The tattered flight suit [the_guy.GetSheHe] was wearing indicates that this was §Y[the_guy.GetName]§! - captain of a small private vessel that vanished without a trace about ten years ago. \n\nAfter medics managed to return [the_guy.GetHerHim] to [the_guy.GetHerHis] senses, [the_guy.GetSheHe] was able to shed light on [the_guy.GetHerHis] story. A sole survivor of [the_guy.GetHerHis] ship's crash on the planet's surface, [the_guy.GetSheHe] has fought for survival ever since, but prolonged isolation, combined with the diet of less than safe to consume local plants, caused [the_guy.GetHerHim] to develop a variety of cognitive problems. Upon spotting the first colonists, [the_guy.GetSheHe] was only able to see them as monsters and attacked."
