Unfortunately, the crowd tore apart the assassin before she could be questioned. This has fuelled conspiracy theories, which claim that someone - perhaps even someone high in the [root.owner.GetAdj] government - was behind the assassination. There are also claims that [root.owner.GetAdj] authorities on [random_visit_planet.GetName] failed to provide [cc_colony_leader.GetName] with adequate security, thus allowing the tragedy to happen. As a result, the pacifist community in the [root.owner.GetName] is up in arms.
